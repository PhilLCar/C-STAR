# C* (C-STAR)
Language creation project: hybrid language that merges C, C++ and C#

Project
=======
The idea is merge the ease of use of C# with the expressability of C, C++. Mainly this 
means a language very close to C#, but where pointers and memory are still accessible.

Implementation
==============
The code will be converted to GAS syntax, the assembly will then be compiled by gcc 
(for now, with the intention of writing the assembler eventually).
